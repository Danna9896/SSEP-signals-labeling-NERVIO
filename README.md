# SSEP-signals-labeling-NERVIO
In this project (final bachelor's project) as a collaboration with NERVIO we recieved SSEP signals that we wanted to label, half were labeled and half weren't. I aimed to label them using a few methods such as SIMCLR, denoising auto-encoder and eventually Pseudo labeling which lead to the best results.
